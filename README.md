# When Was the Golden Age of Video Games?

In this SQL project, I've analyzed the top 400 best-selling video games released since 1977 to identify whether or not the gaming market has improved with time and when its most flourishing epoch was. For this purpose, I've work with video game release years, critic and user scores, and sales data. Here arr the main insights:

- The top 10 best-selling video games of all time and the period they were released
- The top 10 years with the highest average critic scores and many hits produced
- The top 10 years with the highest average user scores and many hits produced
- The years with the highest average scores from both critics and players and many hits produced
- The number of games sold in those years
